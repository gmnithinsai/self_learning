    " ---\n",
    "- Asynchronous code just means that the language has a way to tell the computer / program that at some point in the code,\n",
    " it will have to wait for something else to finish somewhere else. Let's say that something else is called \"foo\".So, during that time, the computer can go and do some other work, while \"foo\" finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then the computer / program will come back every time it has a chance because it's waiting again,\n",
    " or whenever it finished all the work it had at that point. And it will see if any of the tasks it was waiting for have already finished, doing whatever it had to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, it takes the first task to finish (let's say, our \"foo\" ) and continues whatever it had to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- That \"wait for something else\" normally refers to I/O operations that are relatively \"slow\" (compared to the speed of the processor and the RAM memory),like waiting for:\n",
    " - the data from the client to be sent through the network\n",
    " - the data sent by your program to be received by the client through the network\n",
    " - the contents of a file in the disk to be read by the system and given to your program\n",
    " - the contents your program gave to the system to be written to disk\n",
    " - a remote API operation\n",
    " - a database operation to finish\n",
    " - a database query to return the results etc.\n",
    " \n",
    "- As the execution time is consumed mostly by waiting for I/O operations, they call them \"I/O bound\" operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's called \"asynchronous\" because the computer / program doesn't have to be \"synchronized\" with the slow task, waiting for the exact moment that the task finishes, while doing nothing, to be able to take the task result and continue the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of that, by being an \"asynchronous\" system, once finished, the task can wait in line a little bit (some microseconds) for the computer / program to finish whatever it went to do, and then come back to take the results and continue working with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For \"synchronous\" (contrary to \"asynchronous\") they commonly also use the term \"sequential\", because the computer / program follows all the steps in sequence before switching to a different task, even if those steps involve waiting."
